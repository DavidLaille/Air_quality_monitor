# Connected Air quality monitor

The code presented in this repository has been implemented at the National Institute of Applied Science (INSA) of Toulouse.
It is part of the training: Innovative Smart System.
The team working on this project was composed of 2 electronics engineer: Amine Alami and David Laille
and 3 computer engineers: Ting Chen, Cl√©ment Bravo and Tehema Teiti.

The project consists in the realisation of a connected air quality monitor, coupled with a user-friendly interface, here a website. The main objective of this projet is to provide a tool for citizens to monitor by themselves the air quality, especially in big cities.

The air quality monitor gathers a PM sensor (Particulate Matter), a multichannel gas sensor which measure the concentration of ammonia (NH3), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). It also includes other common sensors, such as temperature, pressure and humidity.
