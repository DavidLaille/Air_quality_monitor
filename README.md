This repository has been done for the realisation of an Air quality Monitor.
It is part of the 5th year at INSA Toulouse (Innovative Smart Systems).

The project consists in the realisation of a multiple gas sensor (MiCS-6814 for NH3, CO and NO2).
It also includes a PM sensor (NovaPM) to detect 2.5µm and 10µm Particulate matter, and other common sensors (temperature, pressure, humidity).
